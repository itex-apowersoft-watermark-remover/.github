<h1>Apowersoft Watermark Remover - Overview</h1>

<h2>Purpose of the program</h2>
<p><strong>Apowersoft Watermark Remover</strong> is a desktop application for Windows, designed to help users remove unwanted watermarks, logos, date stamps or other intrusive objects from photos and videos, and optionally add custom watermarks for protection or branding.</p>

<h2>Main Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Remove watermark from images and videos:</strong> remove logos, text stamps, dates or unwanted objects from photos and video frames.</li>
  <li><strong>Batch processing:</strong> import many files at once (photos or videos) and apply watermark removal in bulk.</li>
  <li><strong>Add watermark (text or image):</strong> you can also use the software to add custom text or image watermarks for photos or videos - choose position, transparency, font, effect.</li>
  <li><strong>Wide format support:</strong> works with common image formats (JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF etc.) and video formats (MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Simple interface:</strong> user-friendly UI: drag & drop files, mark unwanted areas using selection tools (rectangle, polygon, brush), then click "Convert".</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain original quality:</strong> processed files are output without (or minimal) quality loss, preserving resolution and format while removing watermarks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unique Aspects</h2>
<p>Unlike simple filters or cropping, Apowersoft Watermark Remover provides tools to selectively remove watermarks or objects - even from complex backgrounds - and supports batch mode and both video & image editing.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>This software is aimed at photographers, videographers, content creators, social media users, or anyone who needs to clean up images/videos from unwanted logos, date stamps or watermarks - or alternatively, to add their own watermark for branding. Home users cleaning old photos or videos may find it useful, as well as professionals preparing content for publication.</p>
